# Context-free Languages

## Theorem

### Thm 8.3

The family of CFL is closed under union, concatenation, and star-closure.

### Thm 8.4

The family of CFL is closed under intersection and complementation.

### Thm 8.5

Let $L_1$ be a CFL and $L_2$ be a regular language. Then $L_1 \cap L_2$ is context-free.

### Thm 8.6

Given a CFG $G = (V, T, S, P)$, there exists an algorithm for deciding whether or not $L(G)$ is empty.

### Thm 8.7

Given a CFG $G = (V, T, S, P)$, there exists an algorithm for deciding whether or not $L(G)$ is infinite.
