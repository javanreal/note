# Hierarchy of Formal Languages

## Definition

### 11.1

A language $L$ is said to be <mark>recursively enumerable (**Turing-recognizable**)</mark> if there exists a Turing machine that accepts it.

Proof: There is an enumeration procedure for a recursive enumerable language $L$

$\text{Let}~ L = L(M)$

$\text{Let}~ \widehat{M} ~\text{print}~ \underset{w_1}{0}, \underset{w_2}{1}, \underset{w_3}{00}, \underset{w_4}{01}, \underset{w_5}{10}, \underset{w_6}{11}...$

$\widehat{M} ~\text{generate}~ w_1 ~\text{and let}~ M ~\text{execute one move on it}~$

$\widehat{M} ~\text{generate}~ w_2 ~\text{and let}~ M ~\text{execute one move on}~ w_2 ~\text{, followed by second move on}~ w_1$

$\text{It is clear that}~ M ~\text{will never get into an infinite loop}$

$\text{Since any}~ w \in L ~\text{is generated by}~ \widehat{M} ~\text{and accepted by}~ M ~\text{in a finite number of steps, every string in}~ L ~\text{is eventually produced by}~ M$

### 11.2

A language $L$ on $\Sigma$ is said to be <mark>recursive (**Turing-decidable**)</mark> if there exists a Turing machine $M$ that accept $L$ and that halts on every $w$ in $\Sigma^+$.

In other words, a language is recursive iff there exists a membership algorithm (decide $w \in L$ or $w \notin L$) for it.

Proof: There is an enumeration procedure for a recursive language $L$

$\text{Let}~ L = L(M)$

$\text{Let}~ \widehat{M} ~\text{print}~ \underset{w_1}{0}, \underset{w_2}{1}, \underset{w_3}{00}, \underset{w_4}{01}, \underset{w_5}{10}, \underset{w_6}{11}...$

$M_2 : \begin{cases} \widehat{M} ~\text{print}~ w_i \\ \text{if}~ M ~\text{accepts}~ w_i ~\text{then prints}~ w_i \end{cases}$

$\text{then it is an enumeration procedure for}~ L$

### 11.3

A grammar $G = (V, T, S, P)$ is called <mark>unrestricted</mark> if all the productions are of the form

$$ u \to v $$

where $u$ is in $(V \cup T)^+$ and $v$ is in $(V \cup T)^*$

### 11.4

A grammar $G = (V, T, S, P)$ is called <mark>context-sensitive</mark> if all the productions are of the form

$$ x \to y $$

where $x, y \in (V \cup T)^+$ and

$$ |x| \leq |y| $$

### 11.5

A language $L$ is said to be context-sensitive if there exists a context-sensitive grammar $G$, s.t. $L = L(G)$ or $L = L(G) \cup \{ \lambda \}$

## Theorem

### 11.1

Let $S$ be an infinite countable set. Then its powerset $2^S$ in not countable.

### 11.2

For any nonempty $\Sigma$, there exist languages that are not recursively enumerable.

> Languages: not countable
> TMs: countable
> $\Rightarrow$ there must exist a language not accepted by any TM

### 11.3

There exists a recursively enumerable language whose component is not recursively enumerable.

### 11.4

If a language $L$ and its complement $\bar{L}$ are both recursively enumerable, then both languages are recursive.

If $L$ is recursive, then $\bar{L}$ is also recursive, and consequently both are recursively enumerable.

### 11.5

There exists a recursively enumerable language that is not recursive; that is, the family of recursive languages is a proper subset of the family of recursively enumerable languages.

Proof:

Consider the language of [Theorem 11.3](#11-3-v2). This language is recursively enumerable, but its complement is not. Therefore, by [Theorem 11.4](#11-4-v2), it is not recursive, giving us the looked-for example.

### 11.6

Any language generated by an [unrestricted grammar](#11-3) is recursively enumerable.

### 11.7

For every recursively enumerable language $L$, there exists an unrestricted grammar $G$, s.t. $L = L(G)$

### 11.8

For every context-sensitive language $L$ not including $\lambda$, there exists some linear bounded automation $M$ s.t. $L = L(M)$

### 11.9

If a language $L$ is accepted by some linear bounded automation $M$, then there exists a context-sensitive grammar that generates $L$

### 11.10

Every context-sensitive language $L$ is recursive.

### 11.11

There exists a recursive language that is not context-sensitive.

## Concept

### The Chomsky Hierarchy

Type 0-3 languages

* Type 0: generated by unrestricted grammars, that is, the recursively enumerable languages
* Type 1: context-sensitive languages
* Type 2: context-free languages
* Type 3: regular languages

Add deterministic context-free language ($L_{DCF}$) and recursive languages ($L_{REC}$)
